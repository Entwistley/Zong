# Zong! Music Notation Project

_Zong!_ is an open-source music notation software, which is currently under development. It will be available on a number of devices and systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and the Web (HTML5 + JS).

To build the project, call `gradlew` in the root folder. To build the Android part, call `gradlew` in the `mobile` folder.
