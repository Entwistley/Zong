Already submitted to gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.bugs:
- 11a-TimeSignatures.xml: the symbol attribute of the first time signature should be "Cut", not "Common"

Fixed locally:
- 02a-Rests-Durations.xml: last note has duration 2 (= undotted 64th), but shows a dotted 128th
  - fixed by p.l.schmidt
- 01b-Pitches-Intervals.xml: only a single measure in MusicXML
  - fixed by p.l.schmidt
